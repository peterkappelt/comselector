# comselector

This is a small utility. Once started (with appropriate parameters) it displays a simple GUI, where all available COM-Ports are listed, the user can select one. The selected CON-Port is simply printed to the command line and can be processed.

I've created this software for batch-scripts, so the user can select a COM-port that is used for further action in the scripts.
